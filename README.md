# Plip Parser
A python code to Parse the txt files produced from PLIP webserver

This code was tried with files containing:

1- Hydrophobic Interactions

2- H-bonds

3- Salt bridges

and was found to work well with them.

Other interactions produced from PLIP was not tried. 

If you have other interactions in your result file and the program could not detect them, raise a new issue and provide the txt file producedfrom PLIP containing the interactions, please.

1- Download the PLIP_parse.py file.

2- Install python 3.7 (if you dont have it), or you can use colab and upload your txt files.

3- install python-docs (pip install python-docx).

    a- from the cmd on your windows.
    
    b- from conda command line (if you have anaconda installed).
    
    c- on colab, use this command (!pip install python-docx). (there is an ! mark at the beginning)
    
4- run the file (python dest_to_py_file).
